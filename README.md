Vector Logos
============
A collection of logos I use in my work.

Motivation
----------
Logos in vector format have smaller file sizes and better resolution. 

Disclaimer
----------
All logos are copyright &copy; their respective copyright owners. I merely converted them to vector format for better distribution.
