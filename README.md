Vector Logos
============
A collection of logos.

Why?
----
Logos in vector format have smaller file sizes *and* better resolution. Can't beat that.

File format
-----------
All files are provided in SVG format, plus a bitmap screenshot in PNG format. Use a vector drawing program such as [http://www.inkscape.org](Inkscape) to edit the SVG.
